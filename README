**This is c++ code for a chess game where two players play as Player1 and Player2.**

**This is a simple approach to just show the constraints of each pieces without an organised GUI 
i.e. the board prints every time a player makes a move, where the player need to give the 
column and row of the piece for who to move and where to.**

**The code shows error message of every type of invalid moves by a player and the game ends 
only when a player kills the KING of the other player.**

**To make it simple, the only condition to win is killing the KING of other player, with 
no other constraints like check and mate as check-mate also means that you can kill the Player's King.**
